        "content": "The Hawaiian language has one of the smallest alphabets in the world. It consists of only 12 letters: five vowels (a, e, i, o, u) and seven consonants (h, k, l, m, n, p, w). This makes Hawaiian words often quite long, as they need more letters to distinguish themselves from other words.",

Others think it might be from the yellow color of common butterflies resembling butter. But there's no definitive answer, and the etymology remains uncertain.",

        "content": "Octopuses have a fascinating circulatory system with three hearts. Two of these hearts (the branchial hearts) pump blood through the gills, where it picks up oxygen. The third heart (the systemic heart) pumps the oxygenated blood to the rest of the body. When an octopus swims, its systemic heart stops beating, which is why they prefer to crawl rather than swim - it exhausts them.",

While experts later questioned his findings, suggesting what he found might be an abandoned field, his innovative approach received significant attention and praise for its creativity.",
